# Neural-Network-Training
This project involves training two networks. The first one tackles a Classification Task and the second one a Regression. 

The first network involves a Binary Classification Notebook using the Bank Note Authentication training set and set up of a tensorflow neural network with 2 layers. After compiling the network, it is trained for 50 epochs.

The second part involves training of a network to learn the function sin(x)cos(x) and setting up of a tensorflow neural network with 3 layers.After compiling the network, it is trained for 50 epochs.

Libraries used: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Altair, Tensorflow
